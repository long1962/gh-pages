        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>We are Chad and Missy Faughn owners of Copper Top BBQ.  We both grew up here in Fredonia and have lived here all of our lives.  For many years Chad has been making the best ribs and BBQ for family and friends and through their encouragement we decided to open Copper Top.   In May of 2013 our dream was finally realized and we started selling our BBQ along with brick oven pizzas.</p>
        <p>Now our days start mighty early with the preparation of delicous slow smoked ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken and our homemade salads, desserts and side dishes.  We put in the hours of commitment and preparation so that the whole family can be satisfied with offerings from home style BBQ meals and "Old World Style" Brick Oven Pizza.</p>
        <p>So if you are traveling along the Trail of Tears or just out on a beautiful drive through sunny valley Fredonia Kentucky, stop by and see us for eat-in or carry-out and maybe take home a pint of our delicious secret recipe sauce.</p>

        <h2>Customer Raves</h2>
        <p>"I was surprised to learn that Coppertop only opened in May 2013. How in the world were they able to perfect absolutely everything is such a short amount of time.  They just passed right by the awkward stage and went straight to a Perfect 10 restaurant."

        <p>"The Old World Style Pizza is the stuff pizza fantasies are made of, though… the San Marzano sauce just does it for me."

        <p>Love the food and the atmosphere. BBQ is melt in your mouth wonderful, BRISKET is awesome. PIZZA is to die for. I'm a picky eater so I ask for my own blend on the pizza and if you ask, they'll make it happen. Come in wearing overalls or suit. You'll feel welcome!
